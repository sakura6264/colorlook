# ColorLook
## A color app written in rust.
Usage: use "Add" button in the menubar to add some colors into the left widget, then use the "Generate" button to generate some images.

the fonts used in this software are from
[NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
The assets/SymbolsNF.ttf is edited from NerdFont
because the color picker widget use the unicode character 'ðŸ“‹'
("\u{1F4CB}"), but I don't want to use the default fonts from egui,
so I copy "\u{f014c}" to it.

The picture at assets/placeholder.png is from a game.
